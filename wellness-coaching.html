			<h1>Wellness Coaching</h1>
			<blockquote>"You can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance at doing what you love."<br><small>Jim Carrey</small></blockquote>
			<p>
				In a wellness coaching session the coach guides the client as they explore areas of their life that are not fulfilling. While looking at areas such as health, fitness, relationships, spirituality, family, career and finances, the client is supported to make choices that are aligned with their own aspirations. By identifying and clarifying values, the client is able to set realistic goals and create a step by step sustainable plan to fulfill the goals. This process builds self-efficacy and evokes the client's own positive internal motivation, empowering them to make changes and move towards a fulfilled life.
