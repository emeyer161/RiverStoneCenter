			<p>
				Each customized massage is 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes.

				<b>Body Assessment:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Before each massage we begin with a body assessment. I speak with you about your body, discussing how you are feeling, what may need attention during the massage and what type of massage is appropriate for you that day. Assessment continues on the table as muscles are palpated providing me the information I need in order to give you a customized treatment.

				<b>Therapeutic Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Therapeutic Massage uses slow/deep techniques to relax your body completely and deeply. When the body is relaxed, your muscles will follow by letting go. From this relaxed state I listen to and follow what your body presents. I spend more time in areas that need the most attention and address tightness, stress, pain, stiffness, and restricted range of motion using a combination of Deep Tissue, Firm Relaxing Swedish Therapeutic Massage, Reflexology, Myofascial Release, Trigger Point Therapy and Stretching.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Medical Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Medical Massage addresses body posture, specific body pain, injury, or areas of restricted range of motion using a combination of Deep Tissue, Myofascial Release, Trigger Point Therapy and Stretching. This can be done in a specific body area or is great in combination with a full body massage. 
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Swedish Relaxing Therapeutic Detox Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					A pleasurable full body massage using long strokes and medium pressure to help the body relax and detoxify. You are invited to either focus on breathing or simply enjoy the massage while muscle tightness and stress float away. Massage helps cells release toxic build-up, increases circulation and oxygen in the blood, and aids in releasing stress-reducing hormones in the body. This is a great choice if you just want to let go and receive.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Massage My Back & Neck:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Either the full session will be dedicated to your back & neck or extra time given before moving on to the remainder of your body. A combination of Deep Tissue, Myofascial Release, Trigger Point Therapy, and Swedish Therapeutic Massage are utilized to address tightness, pain, stiffness, and other issues found. Work is performed in the upper back, shoulders, neck, lower back and into the glutes.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Melt My Feet:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					A full body therapeutic massage with a lot of time spent on the ankles, feel, hands and wrists using reflexology techniques. (OMG, this really feels good.) In addition to serving as the ultimate relaxation experience, this treatment releases toxins, improves circulation, stimulates the nervous system, and may reduce the onset of headaches and migraines.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Make Me Surrender:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Challenged by pesky knots or pain in your muscles? Perhaps this is the treatment for you! A combination of Deep Tissue, Myofascial, Trigger Point Therapy, Reflexology and Swedish massage are used and designed to follow the messages being communicated by your body. Any muscular issues found that may be causing pain, stiffness or imbalance will be addressed. This is the massage of choice if you prefer deep, firm pressure to release tight muscles and trigger points.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Emotional Let-Go Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					During any bodywork at RiverStone, you are encouraged to express what you are feeling on the table as you experience the massage. Allow the release of deep sighs as you ‘let it out and let it go’. During this time, the ‘feeling process’ of self-expression and self-acceptance is honored.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Yogi/Yogini Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Utilizing elements from asana and pranayama, time is spent releasing particular muscles and muscle groups to help increase your range of motion and flexibility, thereby enabling you to move deeper and more gracefully into your favorite yoga poses.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Golf Swing Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Work will be performed on major muscle groups used in a golf swing to increase rotation of the shoulders and hips and address any lower back stiffness. This includes releasing the glutes, quads and hamstrings.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<b>Sports Massages:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Are custom designed, multi-modality massages designed to treat and/or prevent sports related injury or pain. 
					<br />
					<br />


					<b>Athletic Recovery Massage:</b><br />
					<span class='indent'>
						Focuses on specific muscles to help facilitate the healing process as a result of a sports related injury. Using massage and stretching, this treatment also addresses the stiffness, tightness and soreness due to overexertion.
					</span>
					<br><br>

					<b>Sports Conditioning Massage:</b><br />
					<span class='indent'>
