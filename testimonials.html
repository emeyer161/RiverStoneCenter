			<h1>Testimonials</h1>
			
			<p>I had several pain issues walking into my massage and left without them. Not only did he help me while i was there, he recommended something to assist with my pain relief that I have since shared with all of my friends and they are loving it too!!! Give them a try...you will be very happy</p>

			<br />

			<p>I was so very happy to find Jim and the Riverstone Center!  Jim was very knowledgeable and was concerned about me as a client.  As he did my first massage he discussed the techniques he would use and about the pressure he uses and made sure I was comfortable with all aspects of my massage experience.  Jim also took into consideration areas of massage where I experienced some additional pain due to some foot surgery that is still healing.  He worked on that area and greatly improved my level of discomfort.  I would highly recommend Jim to anyone looking for an extremely positive experience either for a first time or an ongoing massage person</p>

			<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my massage and all my problem areas and issues were addressed. I felt much better even the days after massage. I will definitely go back in the future.</p>

			<p>With age, my husband and I had gotten out of shape and felt that we should try natural approaches towards our wellness. We are so grateful to find Riverstone, Jim is excellent at massage and also genuinely cares about his clients. My husband has already gone back for his 2nd visit. I highly recommend this place!!!</p>

			<p>Best massage I've ever had, and Jim has helping me deal with recovering from some severe injuries from over 20 yrs. He is very knowledgeable, professional, and personable. Have had my son, husband, and 87 yr old mother get massages done by Jim</p>

			<p>Wonderful and therapeutic massage. Jim really knows what he's doing. When I leave, I'm pain-free. Look forward to my next massage and so will you!</p>
			<h3>RD (3/6/17)</h3>
						<br />

			<p>My Therapeutic massage at RiverStone Center was amazing. Having experienced numerous therapists over the course of 20+ years, I found Jim’s skill, insight, awareness and sensitivity second to none.  I’d previously enjoyed the full range of massage treatments, including Myofascial Release, Trigger Point Therapy and Swedish, but never in one session with such proficiency and intuition.  If you are seeking a truly transformative experience, schedule an appointment with Jim. You will be glad you did!</p>
			<h3>JW,( 3/1/17)</h3>
			<br />

			<p>I have at least one massage every other month. This was the best I have ever had!</p>
			<h3>AS,( 1/2/17)</h3>
			<br />

			<p>Jim was very professional. It was one of the best messages I have received, he asked questions to find out the best techniques for me. I have some medical concerns that really need a firm massage while other areas need a less firm touch. He talked with me as he massaged and adjusted accordingly. I would recommend Riverstone to anyone who wants a great massage or if you have medical needs that could benefit from a massage.</p>

			<p>I had a wonderful massage. Jim is professional and made me feel very comfortable. The room was inviting, clean and peaceful.</p>
			<h3>MH (9/21/16 )</h3>
			<br />

			<p>Jim was excellent and did a great job. I've been to several different masseuses and generally prefer females but I felt comfortable with him. His style was professional, combining his theoretical knowledge with practicality and a nice touch resulting in a great massage. He's personable. Highly recommend.</p>
			<h3>DC1(2/27/16)</h3>
			<br />

			<p>Jim gave probably the best massage I've ever had. He shares his office with his wife who also has her own practice in a house, but inside is Jims office and massage room. He really listened to my needs and delivered the most relaxing experience. He is professional and knowledgeable! I will definitely be back!!</p>
			<h3>JM (9/3/16)</h3>
			<br />

			<p>Jim is amazing! I am dealing with a lot of lower back pain due to degenerative disk disease and he has provided me with so much relief! He is very good at listening to my problems and issues and addressing them in the massage. He works very hard to help and asks the right questions during the massage that help it be most effective. Thank you Jim!</p>
			<h3>JR (3/3/16)</h3>
			<br />

			<p>Jim was EXCELLENT - that was hands down the best massage I've had.  He was the perfect balance of therapeutic and enjoyable.  A lot of times, if a therapist is 'fixing' some jammed up muscles, the massage isn't very enjoyable - that was NOT the case here!  I feel like Jim addressed the issues I've been having in my neck and back and made real progress in loosening the tight spots while leaving me relaxed.  Two thumbs up!</p>
			<h3>TJ (12/29/15)</h3>
			<br />

			<p>Thanks for the terrific body work!!!! My neck and shoulders are 10 times looser…Truly Amazing</p>
			<br />

			<p>My wrist felt great for the rest of the day, that hasn’t happened for years.</p>
			<h3>B</h3>
			<br />

			<p>Hi Jim,  I was in another world during the massage. It was wonderful, I wanted to let you know that whatever you did, I want it again. The music was a perfect match to what I feel inside. The release is amazing.</p>
			<br />

			<p>(Client’s second massage) I am floating – This only happened to me once before with a massage, it was the first time you gave me one.</p>
