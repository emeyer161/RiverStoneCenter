				<b>Swedish Relaxing Detox Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					A pleasurable full body massage using long strokes and medium pressure that helps the body to relax deeply and detoxify. You can focus on your breathing or just enjoy the massage while muscle tightness and stress are relieved. Massage helps cells release toxic build-up, increases circulation and oxygen in the blood, aids in releasing stress-reducing hormones in the body, aids in increasing brain feel-good chemicals like serotonin and dopamine, increases flexibility, and can help you to sleep better. This is a great one if you just want to let go and receive.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<span class="anchor" id="Therapeutic"></span>
				<b>Therapeutic Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Therapeutic Massage is a full body massage that focuses on what your body needs to feel better. It goes deeper than a Swedish relaxing massage and the intention is to give a therapeutic benefit. I follow your body and apply more firm pressure to relieve tension, stress and muscle tightness that I find. This massage helps your body and mind let go and is very relaxing. This type of massage may have positive effects on people with depression or who feel chronically tired in addition to other benefits of massage.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<span class="anchor" id="Medical"></span>
				<b>Medical Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Some people call this a Neuromuscular Massage. I address body posture, specific body pain, flexibility or areas of restricted range of motion using a combination of deep tissue, myofascial release, trigger point therapy and stretching. This can be done in a specific body area or is great in combination with a full body massage.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<span class="anchor" id="Geriatric"></span>
				<b>Geriatric Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					Geriatric massage therapy addresses the specific needs of the elderly population. I use gentler strokes and go at a slower pace. I address stiffness or discomfort by going into the muscles very carefully and may use soft stretching techniques to open up joints and increase the breath. Massage can enhance blood circulation, increase oxygen to the cells, help with depression, improve balance and flexibility, reduce the pain of arthritis, increase joint mobility, improve posture, and encourage overall well-being. Massage can be especially helpful for maintaining and improving overall health as we age. It also has been shown to relieve anxiety and provide comfort, especially to touch-deprived elderly clients.
					<br>
					If you have a specific health condition, you should receive permission from your physician to clear you before you receive a massage. 
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<span class="anchor" id="LowerBack"></span>
				<b>Lower Back Release Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					I work in you mid back, lumbar spine, hips, sacrum and into the glutes to relieve stiffness, pain, and discomfort. I follow your body and use a combination of deep tissue, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, stretching and firm Swedish massage to address any issues I find.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<span class="anchor" id="NeckShoulder"></span>
				<b>Neck/Shoulder Release Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					I spend most of the session in your upper back, neck, upper traps and shoulders relieving problem areas that may be causing you discomfort or pain. I use a combination of deep tissue, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, and stretching to address tightness, pain, stiffness, decreased range of motion and any issues I find.
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<span class="anchor" id="Sports"></span>
				<b>Sports Massage/Stretching/Athletic Recovery Massages:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					<b>Golf Swing Massage:</b><br />
					<span class='indent'>
						I work on major muscle groups used in a golf swing to increase rotation of the shoulders and hips and address any lower back stiffness. It includes releasing the glutes, quads, hamstrings and neck. 
					</span>
					<br><br>

					<b>Athletic Recovery Massage:</b><br />
					<span class='indent'>
						I address specific muscles to help the healing process of a sports related injury using massage and stretching. I also address injury, stiffness, tightness and soreness due to overexertion.
					</span>
					<br><br>

					<b>Sports Conditioning Massage:</b><br />
					<span class='indent'>
						Promotes body conditioning while helping to prevent sports injury. Assisted stretching increases range of motion while you train for peak performance of a particular sport.
					</span>
					<br><br>

					<b>Yogi Massage:</b><br />
					<span class='indent'>
						I spend time releasing particular muscles and muscle groups to help you increase range of motion and flexibility so you can move deeper into your favorite or difficult yoga pose. 
					</span>
					<br><br>
				</span>
				<br><br>

				<span class="anchor" id="Emotional"></span>
				<b>Emotional Let-Go Massage:</b><br />
				<span class='indent'>
					During any time of your massage, I encourage you to express what you are feeling on the table as you experience the massage. You can let it out and let it go. I honor the feeling process and value awareness, self expression and self acceptance.
