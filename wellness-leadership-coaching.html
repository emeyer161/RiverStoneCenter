				Wellness coaching explores how you are living and helps you take a look at what makes you happy and well.  We look at areas such as health, relationships, family, career, and finances.   I focus on your inner conversations that may involve chronic self-criticism and self-doubt, helping you explore feelings, behavior patterns, and self-beliefs that keep you stuck or not moving toward a life of thriving.  This process is about standing on your own two feet and moving towards a more fulfilled life.  I draw on methods such as self-awareness and Core Energetics which is a combination of talking, emotional release techniques and movement.
