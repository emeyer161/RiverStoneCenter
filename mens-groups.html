			<h1>Men's Groups</h1>
			<blockquote>“You can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance at doing what you Love”<br><small>Jim Carrey</small></blockquote>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Who are you really?</b><br>
				The purpose of the Men's Group is to provide a space to explore who you are as a man, without self-judgment or need of explanation. This is done in the presence of other men. Through discussion and experiential practices, with the support of the group leader and other men, we move toward our edge. Sometimes even going beyond it. You begin to unravel your story and see where you are confining your life to your own imposed limits. The group provides a unique witness to your exploration by supporting and encouraging you to take leadership of your life and to empower you to be your true self.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Topics we may discuss:</b><br>
				Life Struggles<br />
				Relationship issues<br />
				Developing leadership in your life<br />
				Celebrating Life - Finding Peace, grounding and joy<br />
				<br><br>
				<b>Contact Jim for information about forming a new group or joining an existing group. Groups meet once or twice a month usually at night.</b>
