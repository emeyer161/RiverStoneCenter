			<h1>Men's Groups</h1>
			<blockquote>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure."<br><small>Maryanne Williamson</small></blockquote>

			<p>
				<b>Who are you really?</b><br>
				The purpose of the Men's Group is to provide a space to explore who you are as a man, without judgment or need of explanation in the presence of other men. This is done through discussion and experiential practices which move us toward our edge, sometimes even going beyond it. The group provides a unique witness to your exploration by supporting and encouraging you to take leadership of your life.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Topics we may discuss:</b><br>
				Life Struggles and how are we dealing with them<br>
				Relationship issues - partner, parents, siblings, work<br>
				Developing leadership in your life - your purpose & vision<br>
				Celebrating Life - Finding Peace, grounding and joy<br>
				<br><br>
				<b>Contact Jim for information about forming a new group or joining an existing group. Groups meet once or twice a month usually at night.</b>
