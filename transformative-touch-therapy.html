			<blockquote>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.‚Äù<br><small>Maryanne Williamson</small></blockquote>
			
			<p>
				<b>Transformative Touch Somatic Therapy</b> is a fully-clothed treatment using gentle talk and touch to open a dialogue with your body as the starting point to explore the Self. The body reacts, responds, and remembers the story of our lives in its structure, muscles, nervous system, and energy. It has been with us through everything we have ever experienced.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a Transformative Touch session, touch and gentle movement will be used in combination with verbal expressions. Through listening to the messages carried in the body, the intention is to connect the client to the wisdom inherent within.    Your role as a client is to be yourself and allow your body to be a wise resource, ally and guide.
