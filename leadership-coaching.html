			<p>
				Leadership Coaching is about helping you lead your own life. At Riverstone Center we focus on your inner transformation, drawing on methods like self awareness building and Core Energetics to develop life leadership. Core Energetics is a therapeutic method developed by Dr. John Pierrakos. Guidance and support from Jim, a certified Core Energetics practitioner, using Core Energetics techniques helps the client to explore emotions, behavior patterns, and their own self beliefs in order to uncover where and why they are holding back in life. Knowing who you are gives you freedom in life choices.
